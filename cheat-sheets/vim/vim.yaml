        tip:
          description: |
            **Tip:** To jump to a mark you can either use a backtick (`` ` ``) or an apostrophe (`'`). Using an apostrophe jumps to the beginning (first non-blank) of the line holding the mark.

            A local mark is specific to a particular file and is indicated by a lowercase letter, while global marks are universal across all of your files and use uppercase letters. That is, many files can have an `` `a `` mark, while `` `A `` points to a particular location in one particular file.

            "**Tip:** The commands for folding (e.g. `za`) operate on one level.
            To operate on all levels, use uppercase letters (e.g. `zA`). To view
            the differences of files, one can directly start Vim in diff mode by
            running `vimdiff` (`nvim -d`) in a terminal. One can even set this
            as `git difftool`."
